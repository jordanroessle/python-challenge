Python-Challenge

This repository contains two similar projects with their own main.py files.

PyBank: Here main.py reads data from its resource directory and intrepets the bank data. 
	It then prints out financial analysis of the data to both a text file and the command prompt. 

PyPoll: Similarly, main.py reads data from its resource directory and counts the number of votes to determine a winner.
	It then prints out the percetange of votes each candidate got and who the winner was.
